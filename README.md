# tmuxy

Had an idea for this on the train ride home and thought it'd be fun to try and build.  Sometimes the panes are a little buggy, but I've generated some 25 split layouts with it. :octopus:

##Instructions
- [Go to the web app](http://hedgerh.github.io/tmuxy)
- Click on panes and select whether you want to split them vertically/horizontally.
- Drag the bars between panes to resize panes as needed.
- Hit 'Get Script' and check your dev console.

All contributions are greatly appreciated.
